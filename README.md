## Installation

You can install the development version of mapineqr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("e-kotov/mapineqr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(mapineqr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?

``` r

```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
